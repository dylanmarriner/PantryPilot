# PantryPilot

🏠 **The Complete Smart Inventory Management System for Modern Households**

PantryPilot is an intelligent household management platform that revolutionizes how families track, manage, and optimize their pantry inventory. By combining real-time tracking, AI-powered insights, and mobile-first design, PantryPilot helps households reduce food waste by up to 40%, save money through smart purchasing decisions, and simplify meal planning through automated inventory management.

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

Every household faces these daily challenges:

- **Food Waste**: Forgot items in the back of the fridge until they expire
- **Overbuying**: Purchase duplicates of items you already have
- **Budget Overruns**: Unexpected price increases and poor shopping decisions
- **Meal Planning Stress**: Not knowing what ingredients you have available
- **Storage Confusion**: Multiple storage locations with no centralized tracking

PantryPilot solves these problems by providing a single, intelligent platform that knows exactly what you have, where it is, when it expires, and how to use it most effectively.

## ✨ Core Features (In-Depth)

### 📦 **Intelligent Inventory Management**

**What it does**: PantryPilot maintains a real-time, comprehensive inventory of every item in your household across all storage locations.

**How it works**:

- **Multi-Location Tracking**: Track items across pantry, fridge, freezer, cupboards, and even secondary storage like garages or basements
- **Barcode Scanning**: Simply scan product barcodes to instantly add items with all nutritional and categorization data
- **Voice Input**: "Add 2 liters of milk to the fridge" - natural language processing automatically categorizes and locates items
- **Smart Categorization**: AI automatically categorizes items into 200+ categories (dairy, produce, grains, proteins, etc.)
- **Quantity Tracking**: Track items by weight, volume, count, or custom units (cups, tablespoons, etc.)
- **Expiry Management**: Automatic expiry date tracking with visual indicators (green=fresh, yellow=expiring soon, red=expired)
- **Batch & Lot Tracking**: Track specific purchase batches for precise recall management

**Real-world examples**:

- Scan milk carton → Automatically adds to "Dairy → Refrigerator → Top Shelf" with 7-day expiry
- Voice input "bought 3 cans of tomatoes" → Adds to "Canned Goods → Pantry → Shelf 2" with 2-year expiry
- Photo receipt → OCR extracts 15 items and adds them to appropriate locations

### 💰 **Advanced Price Intelligence**
