Project: PantryPilot / Mealify  
Status: Monetization Guardrails (Pre-SaaS)

## 1. PRIMARY VALUE PROPOSITION

Core value:

- Reduce family meal planning stress.
- Provide pantry-aware weekly planning.
- Deliver multi-store price comparison.
- Maintain inventory integrity.

Monetization must not compromise:

- Trust
- Data integrity
- UI calmness
- Planner neutrality

---

## 2. PERSONAL TOOL PHASE

Phase 1 (Kirsty household):

- No ads.
- No affiliate injection.
- No intrusive upsells.
- No monetization logic inside core engine.

Primary objective:
Stability and behavioral validation.

---

## 3. NZ SAAS POSITIONING

Public positioning:
A calm, budget-aware weekly meal planner for families.

Internal reality:
A family food operating system.

Budget awareness is a feature.
Stress reduction is the lead message.

---

## 4. FUTURE MONETIZATION PATHS (LOCKED CONSTRAINTS)

Permissible models:

- Subscription (monthly or annual).
- Tiered feature access.
- Household-based pricing.
- Premium analytics features.

Not permissible:

- Ad-driven model.
- Sponsored meal suggestions.
- Biased price steering.
- Affiliate link manipulation within planner.

Planner must remain neutral.

---

## 5. PRICE ENGINE MONETIZATION RULE

Multi-store price comparison is core value.
It cannot become:

- A pay-to-unlock "cheapest store" feature in a manipulative way.
- A sponsored store bias engine.

If premium tier introduced:

- Additional analytics may be gated.
- Core comparison remains intact.

---

## 6. DATA MONETIZATION PROHIBITION

User grocery data must not be:

- Sold to retailers.
- Shared with third parties.
- Used for targeted advertising.

Aggregated anonymized data may be evaluated later,
but not in Phase 1.

---

## 7. FEATURE GATING STRATEGY (FUTURE)

Possible premium features:

- Advanced price trend analytics.
- Extended pantry insights.
- Multi-household management.
- Advanced reporting exports.

Core weekly planning must remain usable in base tier.

---

## 8. EXPANSION DISCIPLINE

Monetization must never:

- Introduce UI clutter.
- Interrupt planning flow.
- Inject friction into week generation.
- Reduce swap speed.
- Manipulate Explore Mode.

Revenue must not corrupt planner behavior.
