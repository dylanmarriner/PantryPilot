## Workflow

### Planning Phase (ANTIGRAVITY)

1. **Read the planning prompt**: `antigravity_planning_prompt_v2.md`
2. **Get operator input**: Objective, Target Files, Plan ID, Constraints
3. **Analyze the code**: Read target files from workspace
4. **Design the solution**: Complete implementation details
5. **Use the scaffold**: Start with `plan_scaffold.md`, fill in sections
6. **Reference the example**: Check `PLAN_EXAMPLE_JWT_AUTH.md` for correct format
7. **Generate the plan**: Follow exact structure from planning prompt
8. **Lint the plan**: Call `lint_plan({ path: "PLAN_ID.md" })`
9. **Fix any errors**: Re-run lint until it passes
10. **Submit to WINDSURF**: Plan is now sealed and ready for execution

### Execution Phase (WINDSURF)

1. **Read the execution prompt**: `windsurf_execution_prompt_v2.md`
2. **Get operator input**: Plan Path, Workspace Root, Plan Hash
3. **Init sequence**: begin_session, read_prompt("WINDSURF_CANONICAL")
4. **Validate plan**: Hash verification, section check
5. **Extract requirements**: Path Allowlist, Affected Files, Verification Gates
6. **Execute writes**: For each file, call write_file with exact parameters
7. **Verify audit**: After each write, check audit log entry
8. **Run verification**: npm test, npm run lint
9. **Integrity check**: Verify only allowlist files modified
10. **Report**: Success or failure with details

## Plan Structure (Quick Reference)

Every plan MUST have these 7 sections in this order:

```
<!--
ATLAS-GATE_PLAN_HASH: [64-char SHA256 hex]
ROLE: ANTIGRAVITY
STATUS: APPROVED
-->

# Plan Metadata
[Plan ID, Version, Author, Status, Timestamp, Governance]

# Scope & Constraints
[Objective, Affected Files, Out of Scope, Constraints]

# Phase Definitions
[Phase ID, Objective, Allowed/Forbidden operations, Verification commands, Expected outcomes, Failure stop conditions]

# Path Allowlist
[List of workspace-relative paths that can be modified]

# Verification Gates
[Gate 1, Gate 2, etc. - commands to run after implementation]

# Forbidden Actions
[List of actions strictly prohibited]

# Rollback / Failure Policy
[Automatic rollback triggers, Rollback procedure, Recovery steps]
```

---

## Key Rules

### Antigravity Planning

- ✓ Plans must have all 7 sections in order
- ✓ All phase fields must be plain text (no markdown formatting)
- ✓ Phase ID must be UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES
- ✓ No ambiguous language (may, should, optional, try to, attempt to)
- ✓ No stub markers (TODO, FIXME, XXX, HACK)
- ✓ All paths must be workspace-relative (no leading `/`)
- ✓ All constraints must be in binary language (MUST, MUST NOT)
- ✗ Do NOT write code in the plan (plan specifies WHAT, not implementation)
- ✗ Do NOT use mock examples or placeholder implementations in constraints

### Windsurf Execution

- ✓ Call read_prompt("WINDSURF_CANONICAL") FIRST
- ✓ Validate plan hash before executing
- ✓ For each file: call write_file, then verify audit log entry
- ✓ All written code must be complete, production-ready
- ✓ Paths must be in Path Allowlist
- ✓ Run verification commands and check exit codes
- ✗ Do NOT skip verification steps
- ✗ Do NOT continue execution if any step fails
- ✗ Do NOT write stub code, TODOs, or incomplete implementations

### Hash Validation

- Plan hash is SHA256 (64 hexadecimal characters)
- Computed by stripping HTML comment header (lines 1-5) and hashing remaining content
- Must match exactly (case-insensitive comparison)
- If mismatch → STOP immediately, do NOT execute

### write_file Parameters

Required parameters:
- `path`: Workspace-relative, in allowlist
- `content`: Complete code, no stubs
- `plan`: Plan ID
- `role`: EXECUTABLE | BOUNDARY | INFRASTRUCTURE | VERIFICATION
- `purpose`: 20+ character description
- `intent`: 20+ character detailed description
- `authority`: Plan ID
- `failureModes`: How errors are handled

## Common Mistakes

**Planning**:
- ✗ Using ambiguous language ("may", "should", "try to")
- ✗ Phase fields with markdown formatting (**bold**, *italic*)
- ✗ Including code snippets in the plan
- ✗ Paths with leading `/` or parent directory escapes (`..`)
- ✗ Missing any of the 7 required sections

**Execution**:
- ✗ Not calling read_prompt first
- ✗ Skipping hash validation
- ✗ Not verifying audit log after each write
- ✗ Writing code with TODO/FIXME comments
- ✗ Modifying files outside Path Allowlist
- ✗ Continuing execution after a step fails

**General**:
- ✗ Using hash format that doesn't match MCP implementation
- ✗ Assuming plan hash format without verifying
- ✗ Not checking linting errors before execution

## Spectral Linting

**What is Spectral?**
Spectral is a linting tool (like ESLint for JSON/OpenAPI). The plan linter uses custom Spectral rules to validate plan structure and format.

**Spectral Rules in Plan Linter**:
1. `plan-required-sections`: Verifies all 7 sections present
2. `plan-no-stubs`: Detects stub/incomplete code patterns
3. `plan-phase-format`: Validates Phase ID format (UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES)

**Stage 6 Output**: If Spectral rules fail, errors are reported as `SPECTRAL_LINT_ERROR` in the violations list.

---

## Cosign Signing

**What is Cosign?**
Cosign signs plans with ECDSA P-256 cryptography (@sigstore/cosign library). Creates tamper-proof, verifiable plans.

**Signing Process**:
1. Linter strips HTML comment and signature footer from plan
2. Canonicalizes content (trim lines, normalize whitespace)
3. Signs with cosign using private key
4. Returns base64-encoded signature
5. Inserts signature into `COSIGN_SIGNATURE: [base64]` field in header

**Verification Process** (WINDSURF):
1. Extracts COSIGN_SIGNATURE from plan header
2. Strips HTML comment and signature footer
3. Canonicalizes content identically
4. Verifies signature with cosign using public key
5. If verification fails: Plan rejected, execution stops

---

## Linting (Multi-Stage: Spectral + Cosign)

Plans are validated by `lint_plan` which runs 7 validation stages:

**Stages 1-5: Custom Validation**
- Structure: All 7 sections, correct order
- Phases: Valid IDs (UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES), required fields
- Paths: Workspace-relative, no escapes
- Enforceability: No stubs, ambiguous language, or judgment clauses
- Auditability: Plain English objectives, human-readable

**Stage 6: Spectral Linting**
- OpenAPI/Spectral-based custom rules
- Validates format patterns and field requirements
- Checks code quality markers

**Stage 7: Cosign Signing**
- Signs plan with ECDSA P-256 private key
- Returns base64-encoded signature
- Inserts COSIGN_SIGNATURE into plan header

**Run**: `lint_plan({ path: "PLAN_ID.md" })`

**Returns**:
```json
{
  "passed": true/false,
  "hash": "64-char-plan-hash",
  "signature": "base64-encoded-cosign-signature",
  "errors": [...],
  "warnings": [...]
}
```

If `passed: false`, fix errors and re-run.

**On success**:
- Plan is signed with cosign
- Save to `docs/plans/<hash>.md`
- Include COSIGN_SIGNATURE in header comment

---

## File Locations (CRITICAL)

**Plans MUST be stored in**: `docs/plans/`

**Plans MUST be named by ATLAS-GATE_PLAN_HASH**: `<PLAN_HASH>.md`

**Example**:
- Plan Hash (from header): `aeb41114559a6c480b2750d5c8df73806b5bcfc9627a66b3e9f67a0cd1ba4ff2`
- Location: `docs/plans/aeb41114559a6c480b2750d5c8df73806b5bcfc9627a66b3e9f67a0cd1ba4ff2.md`
- Plan also contains: `COSIGN_SIGNATURE: [base64-encoded-signature]` in header

**Why**: WINDSURF looks up plans by ATLAS-GATE_PLAN_HASH using the path resolver. If a plan is saved anywhere else (e.g., `PLAN_AUTH_V1.md`, `plans/my_plan.md`, etc.), WINDSURF cannot find it and execution will FAIL. Plans must also be cryptographically signed with cosign.

**Workflow**:
1. Write plan to temp location: `PLAN_AUTH_V1.md`
2. Lint: `lint_plan({ path: "PLAN_AUTH_V1.md" })` → Validates, signs with cosign, returns hash
3. Save to canonical location: `docs/plans/<hash>.md` (plan now includes COSIGN_SIGNATURE)
4. Deliver plan hash and public key to operator for execution

---

## Audit Trail

Every write operation is recorded in the audit log with:
- Timestamp
- Plan hash
- File path
- Role (EXECUTABLE, BOUNDARY, etc.)
- Intent/purpose
- Audit entry hash (SHA256)

Audit log is immutable and sequential. Cannot be modified or deleted.

## Quick Start

1. Read: `antigravity_planning_prompt_v2.md`
2. Copy: `plan_scaffold.md` → new file `PLAN_YOUR_FEATURE.md`
3. Fill in: All sections with real content
4. Lint: `lint_plan({ path: "PLAN_YOUR_FEATURE.md" })`
5. Fix: Any errors, re-lint
6. Submit: Send plan path and hash to WINDSURF
7. Execute: WINDSURF runs `windsurf_execution_prompt_v2.md` workflow
